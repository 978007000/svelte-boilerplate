# Svelte boilerplate

This boilerplate make it easier to get started with a well-structured SvelteJS application.

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-boilerplate
npm install
```

...then start webpack:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and the page should reload with your changes.

## Deploying to the web

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
npm run build
surge public
```
