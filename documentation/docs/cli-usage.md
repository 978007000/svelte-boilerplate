After starting, an interactive menu will let you configure the component the be created. Firstly, you'll be asked for the type of the component name. Then you'll be prompted with the question of adding style file.

For example, let's go through the steps of the creation of a new page component.

>Enter component name

 - Enter the desired filename for the page. Spaces are not allowed!
 - The tool will check for the existing filenames in the project and reject if found any.

>Do you want to add a style file?

- If you choose yes, a style.scss file is created in to same directory with the component.


After answering questions it generates component, style and test files in miliseconds.
